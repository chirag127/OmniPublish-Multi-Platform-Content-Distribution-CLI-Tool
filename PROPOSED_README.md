## 🏃 Development Scripts

This project uses `npm` scripts for common development tasks. Run these commands from the root of the repository:

| Script         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`  | Starts the development server and watches for changes.                      |
| `npm run build`| Compiles the project for production.                                        |
| `npm run lint` | Runs Biome to check for code style violations and potential errors.           |
| `npm run format`| Automatically formats all code according to Biome's rules.                    |
| `npm test`     | Runs Vitest for unit tests.                                                 |

## 🧪 Testing

Automated testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and stability. We utilize:

*   **Vitest:** For fast and efficient unit testing of individual modules and functions.
*   **Playwright:** For comprehensive end-to-end testing of user flows and platform interactions.

To run all tests:

bash
npm test
npm run test:e2e
