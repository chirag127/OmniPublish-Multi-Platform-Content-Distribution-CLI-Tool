# Blinkit vs Zepto: The Quick Commerce War of 2025

The battle for your doorstep has reached fever pitch. In 2025, "Quick Commerce" isn't just about groceries anymore; it's about _everything_.

## The Speed Barrier

Zepto recently announced "Zepto Turbo," promising delivery in **5 minutes** for select high-density zones in Bangalore and Mumbai. How? By using micro-warehouses located literally inside large apartment complexes. It's a logistical nightmare, but a consumer's dream.

Blinkit, owned by Zomato, has taken a different route. They aren't chasing the 5-minute mark. Instead, they are expanding their catalog. You can now order a **PlayStation 6**, a gold coin, or a printout of your resume via Blinkit, and have it in 15 minutes.

## Profitability?

Surprisingly, yes. Both companies turned EBITDA positive in Q2 2025. The secret wasn't delivery fees (which are still low); it was **Advertising**. These apps have become the new Google for FMCG brands. If a brand wants you to buy their chips, they pay Blinkit to show it on top.

## The Loser: Kirana Stores?

Not really. Smart Kirana stores have partnered with ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) to offer their own local delivery. The real loser is the planned monthly grocery run. Who plans for a month when you can get it in 10 minutes?

## Verdict

Zepto wins on speed for snacks. Blinkit wins on variety for electronics and emergency needs. But both are burning cash to keep you hooked. Enjoy it while it lasts.
