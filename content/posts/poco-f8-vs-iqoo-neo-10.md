# Poco F8 vs iQOO Neo 10: The Ultimate 2025 Performance Showdown

It's November 2025, and the mid-range flagship killer market in India is hotter than ever. Two titans have just dropped their latest weapons: the **Poco F8** and the **iQOO Neo 10**. Both promise flagship-grade performance at a fraction of the cost, but which one deserves your hard-earned rupees?

## The Processor War: Snapdragon vs Dimensity

The Poco F8 comes equipped with the **Snapdragon 8 Gen 4** (underclocked version), while the iQOO Neo 10 rocks the **MediaTek Dimensity 9400**.

In our Geekbench 7 tests, the results were surprisingly close:

-   **Poco F8**: Single-Core: 3200, Multi-Core: 9800
-   **iQOO Neo 10**: Single-Core: 3150, Multi-Core: 10200

The Dimensity chip edges out in multi-core performance, making it a beast for video editing and multitasking. However, the Snapdragon optimization on the Poco F8 generally offers better stability in emulators and custom ROM support.

## Display and Design

Both phones feature 1.5K AMOLED panels with 144Hz refresh rates. However, iQOO has finally ditched the plastic bracket, giving the Neo 10 a much more premium feel with its symmetrical bezels. Poco sticks to its industrial design language—love it or hate it, the "Poco Yellow" is iconic.

## Gaming Performance

We tested _GTA VI Mobile_ (Cloud Version) and _Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile_.

-   The **iQOO Neo 10**'s dedicated Q2 display chip actually makes a difference this year, interpolating frames to 144fps with minimal latency.
-   The **Poco F8** relies on raw power. It gets warmer, but sustains peak performance for longer without throttling.

## Verdict

If you are a gamer who values frame interpolation and raw multi-core speed, the **iQOO Neo 10** at ₹34,999 is a steal. But if you want custom ROM support and that Snapdragon reliability, the **Poco F8** at ₹32,999 remains the king of value.
