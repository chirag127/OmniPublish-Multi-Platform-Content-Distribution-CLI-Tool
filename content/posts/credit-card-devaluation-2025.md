# Credit Card Devaluation 2025: Why Cashback is Dead

Remember the glory days of 2023? You could pay your rent with a credit card, get 2% cashback, and effectively live for free. Well, wake up. It's late 2025, and the party is officially over.

## The Great Slash of '25

Major Indian banks—HDFC, Axis, and ICICI—have all announced massive devaluations this quarter.

-   **Rent Payments**: Now attract a 2% surcharge plus GST.
-   **Utility Bills**: Capped at ₹500 cashback per month.
-   **Lounge Access**: Spend-based criteria have jumped to ₹50,000 per quarter for most entry-level premium cards.

## Why is this happening?

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has tightened unsecured lending norms. The cost of funds has risen, and the interchange fees (MDR) simply aren't covering the cost of these lavish rewards programs anymore. Banks are shifting focus from "customer acquisition" to "profitability."

## The Rise of Co-Branded Cards

While generic cashback is dying, co-branded cards are thriving. The **Swiggy HDFC** and **Amazon ICICI** cards remain untouched because the merchants (Swiggy/Amazon) subsidize the rewards. If you want value in 2026, stop looking for "all-rounder" cards. Build a portfolio of specific co-branded cards for your specific spending habits.

## Conclusion

Cashback isn't dead, but _easy_ cashback is. You can no longer game the system. It's time to audit your wallet and close those cards that are charging you annual fees for benefits you can no longer use.
