# Frugal Bangalore Survival Guide 2025

Bangalore in 2025 is expensive. The average rent for a 2BHK in Indiranagar has touched ₹65,000. A beer costs ₹600. But the city is still the place to be for techies. Here is how to survive without burning your VC funding (or salary).

## 1. Housing: Look Beyond the ORR

Everyone wants to live in HSR or Koramangala. Don't. The Metro Purple Line extension to **Whitefield** and the new Yellow Line to **Electronic City** are fully operational. Living near a metro station in a slightly older area like **Vijayanagar** or **Malleshwaram** can save you ₹15k-20k in rent, and the commute is air-conditioned.

## 2. Transport: Yulu & Metro

Auto drivers are asking for "One and a half" plus a kidney. Stop using them.

-   **First/Last Mile**: Buy a Yulu Wynn or just use the shared Yulu Miracles. They are everywhere.
-   **Long Distance**: The Metro is your lifeline. It's crowded, but it's predictable.

## 3. Food: Darshinis are Gold

Stop ordering from Swiggy every day. The "Darshini" culture of Bangalore is the healthiest fast food in the world. Idli-Vada for ₹60 is a balanced breakfast. For lunch, look for "Andhra Mess" unlimited meals. They are nutritious, filling, and cost under ₹150.

## 4. Entertainment: Cubbon Park is Free

Malls are money pits. Cubbon Park, Lalbagh, and the countless lakes (which are actually clean now, thanks to the 2024 rejuvenation project) are free. The best networking happens at the open-air tech meetups in HSR parks on Sunday mornings anyway.

## Conclusion

Bangalore takes a lot, but it gives back in opportunities. Be smart with your fixed costs (rent), and you can enjoy the city without the financial stress.
