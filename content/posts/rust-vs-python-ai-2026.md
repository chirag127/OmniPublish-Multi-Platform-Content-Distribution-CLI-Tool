# Why Rust is the New Python for AI

Python has ruled AI for decades, but Rust is catching up. With the need for high-performance inference at the edge, Rust's memory safety and speed are becoming non-negotiable. New frameworks like 'Candle' are challenging PyTorch's dominance in production environments.

## Why this matters in 2025

The landscape of Coding is shifting rapidly. As we move further into the decade, trends like these will define the market.

## Conclusion

Stay tuned for more updates on this topic.
